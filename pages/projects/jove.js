All of these, however, needed to be tied with a unique story that would set the brand apart from its competitors. <br /><br />During our brainstorming sessions, we singled out several traits that the brand needed to embody: premium quality, reliability and an elaborate, convincing back story. That is how Jove came to be with new imagery, product label and website design.",
